# QuoteMachine

I made a Quote MAchine using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. Also I've used APi for quote data. All the quotation will appear randomly. You can take a look on the deployed website. Here is the # Demo Link :  https://getyourquotenow.netlify.app/

# Addtionally, here are some preview:

if you want to use it, you can clone it or you can download the zip file and use it accordingly.
If you think of a new project which we can try to build together. So, please reach me out, happy to work together.
